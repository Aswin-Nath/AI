Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.\\n3. **Deliver working software**: Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\\n4. **Business people and developers work together**: Business people and developers work together daily throughout the project.\\n5. **Face-to-face conversation**: Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team.\\n6. **Working software is the primary measure of progress**: Working software is the primary measure of progress.\\n7. **Sustainable development**: Sustainable development is the key to long-term success.\\n8. **Continuous attention to technical excellence**: Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\\n9. **Simplicity**: Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.\\n10. **Self-organizing teams**: The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\\n11. **Regular reflection**: Regular reflection and adaptation are essential.\\n12. **Improvement**: At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more agile and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\\n\\n**Comparison of PERT Chart and Gantt Chart:**\\n\\n| Feature | PERT Chart | Gantt Chart |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Purpose | Visualize project tasks and dependencies | Schedule tasks over time |\\n| Focus | Task relationships and sequence | Task duration and timeline |\\n| Representation | Network diagram with nodes and arrows | Horizontal bar chart |\\n| Time Estimation | Includes optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely durations | Shows start and end dates |\\n| Complexity | More complex, suitable for large projects | Simpler, easier to read |\\n| Flexibility | Adaptable for changing project paths | Less flexible once established |\\n| Best Use Case | Research and development projects | Construction and production schedules |\\n\\n**Key differences:**\\n\\n* PERT Chart focuses on task relationships and sequence, while Gantt Chart focuses on task duration and timeline.\\n* PERT Chart uses a network diagram with nodes and arrows, while Gantt Chart uses a horizontal bar chart.\\n* PERT Chart includes optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely durations, while Gantt Chart shows start and end dates.\\n* PERT Chart is more complex and suitable for large projects, while Gantt Chart is simpler and easier to read.\\n* PERT Chart is adaptable for changing project paths, while Gantt Chart is less flexible once established.\\n\\n**When to use each:**\\n\\n* Use PERT Chart for research and development projects that require a high degree of flexibility and adaptability.\\n* Use Gantt Chart for construction and production schedules that require a high degree of precision and predictability.\"}]"

Identifying tasks means listing all the \\nsteps needed to complete a project. Start by figuring out what the main goal is, then break it \\ndown into smaller actions. Ask team members for ideas and use clear action words for each \\ntask. \\nStep 2: Define task dependencies \\nDefining task dependencies means figuring out which tasks must be completed before \\nothers can start.

It's about \\nbeing quick to adapt, working closely with customers, and delivering value in small doses. \\nThis approach has become popular for many companies because it helps them meet \\nchanging needs and make customers happy. \\nUse the Agile model when your project needs to be flexible, your customers' needs might \\nchange, and you want to deliver small parts of your project regularly to make them happy.\\n\\n[Document 19]\\n    Source: C:\\\\Users\\\\aswin\\\\Projects\\\\GenworxTraining\\\\Self_Learn\\\\AI\\\\LangChain\\\\Unit 2 SPM.pdf\\n    Page: 16\\n    Section: N/A\\n    Content:\\n    evaluate the requirements.  \\n\\uf0b7 Demo of working software is given to understand the customer's requirements. That is, \\nit does not depend only on documentation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Incremental versions of the software have to be delivered to the customer representative \\nafter a few weeks. \\n\\uf0b7 In this model it is advised that the size of the development team should be small (5 to 9 \\npeople) so that the team members can communicate face to face. \\n\\uf0b7 Agile model focuses on the fact that whenever any changes have to be made in the \\nsoftware, it should be completed quickly. \\n\\uf0b7 In agile development, two programmers work together. One programmer does the \\ncoding and the other reviews that code. Both the programmers keep changing their \\ntasks, that is, sometimes one does coding and sometimes someone reviews.\\n\\n[Document 20]\\n    Source: C:\\\\Users\\\\aswin\\\\Projects\\\\GenworxTraining\\\\Self_Learn\\\\AI\\\\LangChain\\\\Unit 2 SPM.pdf\\n    Page: 25\\n    Section: N/A\\n    Content:\\n    on speed while taking the demands of customers into account throughout the product \\ndevelopment life cycle. As compared to traditional Waterfall approaches, which follow a \\n‘linear and sequential’ process, Agile uses iterative cycles of operation; developers can \\nreturn to customers for feedback or modifications constantly. That is a mindset that \\nprioritizes people and interactions over processes and systems, working products over \\ndetailed documentation, and customer collaboration over contract negotiation. \\nWhat is Agile Project Management? \\nAgile Project Management is a revolutionary approach, that is aimed at continuously \\ndelivering solutions for the changing requirements of the project in a spiral way. \\n1. It was established by the Agile Manifesto’s principles, calling for iterative and \\nincremental development of the project into manageable sprints that create potentially \\nshippable increments.\""
